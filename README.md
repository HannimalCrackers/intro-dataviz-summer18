# Introduction to Data Visualization
- CUNY Graduate Center | Summer 2018
- TODO Course Number
- Monday - Thursday 6:00 to 8:00 | 5/29 - 6/21 | TODO Location
- Office Hours: By Appointment
- Taught by: Erin Daugherty and Michelle McSweeney

## Description
As employers in every sector continue to search for candidates that can turn their data into actionable information, this course is designed to demystify data analysis by approaching it visually. Using Tableau Software, we will build a series of interactive visualizations that combine data and logic with storytelling and design. Over the course of four weeks, we will dive into cleaning and structuring unruly data sets, identifying which chart types work best for different types of data, and unpacking the tactics behind effective visual communication. Our data sets will be geared towards humanities and social science research, and Tableauâ€™s drag-and-drop interface will not require coding. Regardless of your academic concentration, you will walk away from this class with a portfolio of dynamic dashboards and a new interdisciplinary skill set ready to leverage in your academic and professional work.

## Our Objectives
By the end of this class, you will be able to:

1. Generous Community Member
- Structure thoughtful critiques and offer technical solutions to enhance the work of your classmates
- Leverage collaborative tools, including Tableau Public, Github, and repositories of public data sets
- Contribute to the broader conversation about digital practices in academic research

2. Conscientious Consumer
- Critically read a wide range of chart types with an eye for accuracy, audience, and effectiveness
- Identify potential weaknesses in the collection methods and structure of underlying data sets 
- Locate the original source of a visualization and its data

3. Iterative Builder
- Build interactive data visualization dashboards that answer a clear and purposeful research question
- Choose which chart type works best for different types of data
- Iterate with fluidity in Tableau Software leveraging visualization, aesthetic, and user interface best practices


## Assignments
During this course, you will complete four assignments: 2 blog posts and a final portfolio accompanied by a white paper. We expect that you will turn in each project before you feel fully ready to do so. You are more than welcome to submit significant revisions of the first two blog posts until you're satisfied with the project. Just note that we will not re-grade projects that have already received an A.

## Our Schedule
We will cover a lot of ground in just four weeks. Strong attendance will be essential for doing well in this course. Each class period will be divided into two parts. First, we'll use our seminar time to dive into a theoretical component underpinning data visualization. You'll find the readings you should prepare for each class period listed below. Then, we'll use the second half of the class for a hands-on tutorial in Tableau. You do not need to prepare anything ahead of time for this section of class.

## A Few Final Thoughts
- one paragraph letter to the students
- we are here to help you, ask questions, speak up when you're confused
- be generous with your knowledge; these contributions are more valuable than hording information
- if there's something you wanted to learn and you're not seeing it here, let us know
- if you do not have easy access to a laptop during class, let us know
- what information does CUNY provide regarding disability or academic resources?
- we are striving for progress, not perfection. -Erin & Michelle
