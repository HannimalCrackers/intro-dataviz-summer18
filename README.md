## Description
As employers in every sector continue to search for candidates that can turn their data into actionable information, this course is designed to demystify data analysis by approaching it visually. Using Tableau Software, we will build a series of interactive visualizations that combine data and logic with storytelling and design. Over the course of four weeks, we will dive into cleaning and structuring unruly data sets, identifying which chart types work best for different types of data, and unpacking the tactics behind effective visual communication. Our data sets will be geared towards humanities and social science research, and Tableauâ€™s drag-and-drop interface will not require coding. Regardless of your academic concentration, you will walk away from this class with a portfolio of four dynamic dashboards and a new interdisciplinary skill set ready to leverage in your academic and professional work.
