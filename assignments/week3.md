## Blog Post 3

### Premise

For this project, you will find a dataset that interests you, most likely drawing on your academic discipline. There is a sizable list of resources that you can draw from. For this project, it will benefit you to first think of a broad topic that you want your project to be about - this will help you narrow your search for data. Therefore, begin with the research question and proceed from there. This project is unlike the other two because you will have the opportunity to iterate on it extensively as you will submit it twice. Correspondingly, the scope can be larger and it should be something you are truly interested in. You may want to think of this in terms of story telling and prepare to incorporate multiple visuals into the final product. 


### Part I: Project Proposal 

**DUE 6pm Friday, June 15** (15%)

You will submit, via email, an approximately 1 page project proposal that addresses:
1. **A research question.** Your question can take the shape of a question, topic, or title, but it must be coherent and the type of question that can be addressed in a data visualization. For example, your project may start with "What portion of American discourse on gun control is really about guns?"
2. **Justification for the question**. Why should we care about your question? Why is it important? This will likely be situated within your discipline and may draw on theoretical tensions within your discipline or can be appropriate for a general audience. 
3. **The data you will use to address your question**. You must include what dataset you plan to use, where you got it, and how it is formatted (and your data cleaning plan if applicable). 
4. **A sketch of how you will visualize your data**. The sketch must be visual, preferably hand drawn. You may sketch it on a computer in a program such as [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) or [Tayuski Sketches for iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tayasui-sketches/id641900855?mt=8), [Medibang Paint](https://downloads.tomsguide.com/MediBang-Paint,0301-70484.html), etc. The point is that it should not be a computer generated graph or other visual at this stage.

We will provide you with feedback by **Friday night at midnight**. We cannot take late submissions, but can take early ones. This timeframe is to ensure that what you have planned is reasonable and realistic. If we have revisions, you will not need to submit a revised proposal. However, if there are major changes that need to be made, we may ask to schedule a video chat over the weekend to help reframe your project. 

### Part II: Visualization and Blog Post 

**DUE 12midnight Sunday, June 17** (70%)

You will post a blog post on your Github page that includes:
1. **Your research question and description of the data** It is ok if this has changed since submitting the proposal, but must reflect the question or topic you have addressed in *this* version of your visualization.
2. **Context for the novice reader** So a stranger visiting your site understands why your question or topic is interesting and important
3. **Your visualization made in Tableau Public**
4. **An explanation of the data and design decisions you made** This section should illustrate what you did and why you did it. What data did you choose - were there any problems with the data? What were they? How did you solve them? Why did you choose the type of chart/graph/visualization that you did, how does that choice best represent the data and address your question? Did you have to change tact at any point, and if so, why? Through this explanation, you will illustrate that the decisions you made were intentional and how they contribute to the project. If there are compromises you had to make with the data or design, they should be explained here (and where you ended up with the compromise and why). If you used the defaults, explain why they were the best option for your visualization and your question.
5. **Next Steps**. What are the next steps you would take given the opportunity - how would you iterate on it to either make it better, constrain it, or develop it. Where does this project go from here?

The written component should be approximately 750-2,000 words

### Part III: Pin Up 

**DUE in class June 18** (15%)

The final component is a pin up and critique. You must be present in class for the critique. Since critique is essential but ephemeral, if you have extenuating circumstances that prohibit you from attending a Monday session, contact Michelle and Erin in advance to make arrangements. 

1. Be present to receive feedback of your work
2. Offer thoughtful feedback on others' work

Some questions to help shape feedback:

* How was the data collected? How reliable is the data?
* Does the data address the question?
* Does the visualization address the question?
* Does the visualization fit the data?
* Who is the intended audience of this visualization?
* Was the author successful in depicting the relationships in the data? 
* Is the output informative and honest, or misleading?

#### Some notes 

You can use as many or as few visuals to address your question/topic as you wish and as you feel is appropriate.  We expect that you will turn things in before you feel they are complete. That is normal. You can continue to iterate on them until you are satisfied, but the first version must be completed by Sunday night (we will re-assess the grade if appropriate). 

Finally, we expect that the end product (from the website to the visualizations) will be reflective of you and your style and that everyone's will be very different. The objective is that you will have a portfolio of work at the end of the semester that illustrates your visualization skills. If you already have a portfolio or a personal site, talk to us about how to incorporate the two.



### Evaluation
