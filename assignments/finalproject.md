## Final Portfolio

### Premise

For the final portfolio project, you will formulate a research question that interests you, find a dataset to address that question, and finally visualize it. This  will most likely drawing on your academic discipline or personal interest. Start this project with a research question and then search for data that can address it. Once you have the question/topic and the data, then you can consider how best to visualize it. There is a sizable list of [resources](https://github.com/dataviz-gc/intro-dataviz-summer18/blob/master/resources.md) that you can draw from - these are only suggestions. This project is unlike the other two because you will have the opportunity to iterate on feedback from the PinUp before the final submission (and will therefore have 2 weeks to work on it). Correspondingly, the scope can be larger and it should be something you are truly interested in. You may want to think of this in terms of story telling and prepare to incorporate multiple visuals into the final product. Finally, you may use any visualization technique you wish. So, if you want to illustrate, sew, install, or perform your visualization, indicate this in your project proposal (if you want to do something radical, please discuss with Michelle and Erin first, though).

### Part I: Project Proposal 

**DUE 6pm Friday, June 15** (10%)

You will submit, via email, an approximately 1 page project proposal that addresses:
1. **A research question.** Your question can take the shape of a question, topic, or title, but it must be coherent and the type of question that can be addressed in a data visualization. This should be more in line with a research question you would pose for a final paper. For example, your project may start with "What portion of American discourse on gun control is really about guns?"
2. **Justification for the question**. Why should we care about your question? Why is it important? This may be situated within your discipline and draw on those theoretical tensions or it can be broad and appropriate for a general audience. 
3. **The data you will use to address your question**. You must include what dataset you plan to use, where you got it, and how it is formatted (and your data cleaning plan if applicable). 
4. **A plan detailing how you will visualize your data**. The sketch must be visual, preferably hand drawn. You may sketch it on a computer in a program such as [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) or [Tayuski Sketches for iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tayasui-sketches/id641900855?mt=8), [Medibang Paint](https://downloads.tomsguide.com/MediBang-Paint,0301-70484.html), etc. The point is that it should not be a computer generated graph or other visual at this stage. Attach this as an image to the email.

We will provide you with feedback by **Friday night at midnight**. We cannot take late submissions, but can take early ones. This timeframe is to ensure that what you have planned is reasonable and realistic. If we have revisions, you will not need to submit a revised proposal. However, if there are major changes that need to be made, we may ask to schedule a video chat over the weekend to help reframe your project. 

### Part II: Visualization and Blog Post 

**First Draft DUE 12midnight Sunday, June 17** 
**Final Draft DUE in class June 20 or 21** (75%)

You will post a blog post on your Github page that includes:
1. **Your research question and description of the data** It is ok if this has changed since submitting the proposal, but must reflect the question or topic you have addressed in *this* version of your visualization.
2. **Context for the novice reader** This should be more fully developed, addressing the what and why, and fully articulating what is at stake in your question.
3. **Your visualizations made in Tableau Public**
4. **A brief explanation of the data and design decisions you made** These decisions will be more fully addressed in the white paper, so this section can be more abbreviated. Articulate  what you did and why you did it. What data did you used, and where it came from. Why you chose the type of chart/graph/visualization that you did, and how it affected the end result. 
5. **Next Steps**. What are the next steps you would take given the opportunity - how would you iterate on it to either make it better, constrain it, or develop it. Where does this project go from here?

The written component should be approximately 500-1,500 words

### Part III: Pin Up 

**DUE in class June 18** (15%)

The final component is a pin up and critique. You must be present in class for the critique. Since critique is essential but ephemeral, if you have extenuating circumstances that prohibit you from attending a Monday session, contact Michelle and Erin in advance to make arrangements. 

1. Be present to receive feedback of your work
2. Offer thoughtful feedback on others' work

Some questions to help shape feedback:

* How was the data collected? How reliable is the data?
* Does the data address the question?
* Does the visualization address the question?
* Does the visualization fit the data?
* Who is the intended audience of this visualization?
* Was the author successful in depicting the relationships in the data? 
* Is the output informative and honest, or misleading?

#### Some notes 

You can use as many or as few visuals to address your question/topic as you wish and as you feel is appropriate.  We expect that you will turn things in before you feel they are complete. That is normal. You can continue to iterate on them until you are satisfied, but the first version must be completed by Sunday night (we will re-assess the grade if appropriate). 

Finally, we expect that the end product (from the website to the visualizations) will be reflective of you and your style and that everyone's will be very different. The objective is that you will have a portfolio of work at the end of the semester that illustrates your visualization skills. If you already have a portfolio or a personal site, talk to us about how to incorporate the two.
